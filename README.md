## SillyStories

Collectively creative writing game where one person writes a sentence and others will continue the story, but only seeing the last sentence. 

Once there are 20 sentences, the app automatically creates a story, publishes it on the complete-stories page and deletes the sentences.
The next user is being shown the new-story page and can choose whether to see all the complete story, or to start a new one.

Users are able to decide if they wanted to receive the complete story via email.
